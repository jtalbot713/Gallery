<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<div>Founded in 1967 by the Helene Watermann, a prominent historian and patron of local artists, the Watermann Gallery is dedicated to advancing an appreciation of art and history in Green Valley. Watermann is not only the home for historical artifacts important to preserving the unique character of Green Valley, but also a place where visitors can experience exhibitions of fine art and participate in a variety of art and history-based programs.

Exhibitions and programs are all undertaken in an effort to provide the residents of Green Valley with a way of integrating art and history into their lives and taking away the lessons that these disciplines offer. By presenting quality exhibitions and programs, as well as committing to the proper care and preservation of works of art and artifacts relating to history and culture of Green Valley, the Watermann Gallery is the regionâ€™s center for art and historical engagement.</div>
